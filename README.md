# Minimalist Python Chess Program

# Description:
I implemented chess using python and pygame for my 2021 winter project.
I have tried to make the code as simple and minimalistic as possible, cutting away variables and lines that are not 
needed without sacrificing code quality or leading to confusion.

The resulting code is only 380 lines long and comes complete with GUI, legal move display, castling, enpassant 
and pawn promotion (auto queen).

Credits to my friends who helped me out along the way. Enjoy!

# Possible Extensions:
1. Move history and undo
2. Pawn underpromotions
3. 3-fold repetition and 50 move draw
