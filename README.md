Todo list

Basic:
1. Cut down the code to bare minimum (done)
2. Implement the chessboard correctly (done)
3. Implement the pieces correctly (done)
4. Implement GUI (fix bugs)


Extensions:
1. implement castling (done)
2. implement en passant
3. implement stalemate rules (done, not done with 3 fold rep (is there a need to?))
4. implement move history
5. implement undo (do we need this?)
6. implement pawn promotion (done auto queen)

Bugs:
1. Legal move sometimes is bugged, eg, bishop can move there but legal move show cant
2. Pins dont work, king will still die to the threat
3. Check for checkmate/stalemate
4. pawns can still move 2 steps after first move, first move function doesnt work.
